Creating a simulation of a multi-server system on a local machine is challenging in Raft, as each server in the real world has its own memory. In a local simulation, however, we encounter the problem of shared memory. Rust's strict memory management makes it difficult to simulate this scenario locally, even though the logic is sound. This approach should work in a real-life scenario, but the current simulation is somewhat vague <a href="https://github.com/SurajNaidu0/CATALOG-Assigment/blob/main/Implementation%20Of%20Baisc%20Raft%20Consensus%20in%20Rust/VersionWithSimulator.rs">Link</a>.
